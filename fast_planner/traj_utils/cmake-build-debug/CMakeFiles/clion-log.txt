CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findbspline.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "bspline", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "bspline" with any
  of the following names:

    bsplineConfig.cmake
    bspline-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "bspline" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "bspline_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "bspline" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
